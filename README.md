2.Differentiate between UI and UX using real-world case studies.

3.Illustrate the relationship between UI and UX in design.

4.Demonstrate various UI/UX design tools in detail.



## Output:
1. Explore the Fundamentals of UI and UX

     UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are foundational aspects of digital product design. UI focuses on the look and feel of a product—the visual elements such as buttons, icons, spacing, colors, and        typography. UX, on the other hand, is about how a user feels while interacting with the product—ease of use, logical flow, user satisfaction, and overall functionality. Understanding both is essential 
      because a   well-designed interface enhances user experience, while poor UX can make even a beautiful interface frustrating to use.

2. Differentiate Between UI and UX Using Real-World Case Studies To understand the distinction between UI and UX, analyzing real-world case studies proves insightful. For instance, comparing early versions of         mobile apps like Instagram or Snapchat with their current versions shows how UI improvements (like cleaner layouts and intuitive icons) were made alongside UX enhancements (like faster load times, better          onboarding processes, and easier navigation). These case studies highlight how a strong UI does not guarantee good UX, and vice versa. They also reveal how design decisions impact user engagement and         
    retention.

3. Illustrate the Relationship Between UI and UX in Design

   UI and UX are deeply interconnected. A user-friendly experience requires an interface that supports intuitive actions. For example, a clean UI with consistent navigation helps users find what they need 
    quickly, thus contributing to a positive UX. Similarly, if users

     encounter a great UX flow (such as smooth checkout processes in e-commerce apps), it must be supported by clear and responsive UI elements. This interdependence shows that neither UI nor UX can be effective 
     in 
     isolation—they must be designed together for a successful product.

4. Demonstrate Various UI/UX Design Tools in Detail

     Several tools are available to help designers create and test UI/UX designs.

      Figma is a cloud-based interface design tool that allows real-time collaboration and prototyping. It’s ideal for team projects.

      Adobe XD offers powerful features for wireframing, prototyping, and sharing interactive designs, with good integration into the Adobe ecosystem.

      Sketch is popular among macOS users and known for its vector-based UI design capabilities and plugin support.

       InVision is mainly used for prototyping and presenting design workflows interactively.

       Each of these tools plays a role in transforming ideas into user-centered digital products. During hands-on sessions, students can explore their interfaces, design layouts, create wireframes, and test user 
       flows.
## Result:
Implementation of Hands-on UI/UX Experiments is done successfully.
